# MyPortfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is where I showcase my skills, projects, and achievements as a Software Engineer. The portfolio includes a clean, responsive design with sections that highlight my technical expertise and personal journey.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
- **Skills Showcase**: Displaying a list of technical skills and tools I work with.
- **Projects Section**: Highlights the projects I've worked on, with links to detailed descriptions and code repositories.
- **Contact Form**: A contact form that allows visitors to send me messages (using PHP mail function, or SMTP if necessary).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend**: PHP (for the contact form)
- **Libraries**: Bootstrap (for responsive layout), AOS (for animations)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CoderDebajyoti/MyPortfolio.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd MyPortfolio
    ```

3. Open `index.html` to view the website locally in your browser.

4. If you want to use the contact form, you will need to set up a PHP server (e.g., using XAMPP or a live web hosting service). You can test the form locally by configuring the PHP `mail()` function or by using an SMTP service like PHPMailer.
